⚠️ **Rules for this file:**
- Append-only. Do not delete or remove lines.  
- If a task changes, **comment out** the old line (prefix with `~~` for strikethrough in Markdown) and add a new one beneath it with the updated info.  
- Each task must have:
  1. A unique ID (TODO-001, TODO-002, …)  
  2. A date added  
  3. A short description  
  4. Optional tags (e.g., [backend], [frontend], [bug], [feature])
